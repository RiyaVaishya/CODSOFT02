## TASK-02

# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Description:-
This project aims to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. The model utilizes regression techniques to tackle this problem. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

The project enables exploration of data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows the user to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

## Dataset:-
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies). It contains historical movie data including features like genre, director, actors, year of release, duration, and movie ratings. Each row in the dataset represents a single movie, and the columns contain various attributes of the movies.

## Steps Involved:-
The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical movie data including features like genre, director, actors, and movie ratings.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and performing any necessary transformations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions and relationships between variables to gain insights into the data.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that can help improve the model's performance. This may involve converting categorical variables into dummy variables or extracting additional information from existing features.

5. **Model Building**: Choose appropriate machine learning models for regression tasks. Train the models using the prepared data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). Visualize the results to gain insights into model performance.

7. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict movie ratings for new data.

## Dependencies:-
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion:-
The movie rating prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict movie ratings based on various features. By building and evaluating machine learning models, the project provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and enables the development of accurate rating prediction models.
